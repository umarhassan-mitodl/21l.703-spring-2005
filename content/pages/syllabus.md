## Course Overview

Forty years after *Macbeth* first entertained King James with a "happy ending" that included the usurper's head being paraded around the stage on a pike, the Parliament of England sanctioned the public beheading of James' son King Charles I - having earlier closed the public theaters. What happened to Shakespeare and other staples of the Renaissance dramatic repertory during the English Civil War and the subsequent theatrical "time of silence"? What had people been "seeing" at the theater and how did it confirm or threaten political, religious, and social authorities? And finally, how did theatrical energies and ways of seeing connect with or diverge from the emergent practice of experimental science that resulted in the founding of The Royal Society, once the monarchy was "restored" in 1660 and the theaters (forever transformed) reopened? How have we, like drama and science, changed since then?

We will explore the place of drama in a world turned upside down, with special attention to the "theatricality" of the new models and perspectives afforded by scientific experimentation. This subject itself is a creative experiment in learning. Working in collaboration as 21L.703 (Studies in Drama) and 21M.714 (Selected Topics in Theater Arts), we will expand our understanding of drama through workshops, theatrical experimentation, reading, and research, drawing on a wide array of texts and sources from both the seventeenth century and our own time. In order to understand the impact and fate of plays by Shakespeare, Ford, Shirley, and Brome, we will look at selections from philosophy (Hobbes, Descartes), literature (Milton, Marvell, Pepsys), science (Hooke, Crooke) and the visual arts (Jones, Van Dyke), as well as the insights of modern historians, scholars, and artists. Working with visitors from the world of contemporary theater, the class will culminate in the development of materials for an original play based on these themes, which we hope will be produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company as well as by students at MIT.

In addition to our group participation in developing theatrical material, here is my set of five "super-objectives" for you as a student:

1. To provide the tools and nurture your ability to read a variety of genres (including drama, philosophical essays, and scholarly writing) more seriously, pleasurably, and critically; I hope this will encourage you to remain a reader of challenging material throughout your life.
2. To increase your consciousness of historical, political, scientific, philosophical, religious, and artistic questions and approaches to the world, so that you can function more sensitively, intelligently, and effectively in the world.
3. To encourage a clearer understanding of your own personal skills and creativity, increasing your self-awareness and the accuracy of you self-analysis, so that you can sustain a realistic sense of confidence and are better positioned to achieve whatever goals you set for yourself.
4. To improve and refine your abilities to express and communicate ideas, feelings, and arguments effectively and persuasively, so that you can know what you believe and can contribute and lead as a member of a team or community.
5. To encourage your understanding and enjoyment of the past and present, of art and science, of individual achievements and the shaping role of social organizations-and your awareness of the relationships among all of the above.

## An Important Note on Reading

We use the word "read" in a variety of ways, and we will be practicing a variety of reading methods in this subject. You will be skimming, dipping into, appreciating and on occasion thoroughly dissecting diverse genres of written texts.

Here's what I say to first-time students of drama about reading scripts written for performance:

1. Read through the entire play quickly, as if you were an audience member watching it take place before you (i.e., read sequentially and don't worry about every detail or go back over a scene studiously-though try to attend to as many clues and dimensions of the script as you can). Consider the play's sequence and impact.
2. Re-read slowly and analytically, looking for meanings, patterns, poetry, characterization and themes, and studying the sections that confused you. Consider the play's artistry and ideas.
3. Reflect upon some particular aspect or angle, a character or scene or dimension of thought, language, or staging, that particularly interests you. Consider why it does.

This breaks the process of reading into three parts, which might be likened to consumption, meditation through analysis, and meditation through personal reflection. Once you get comfortable and even adept at analyzing dramatic texts, you might be able to juggle all three, but usually the process requires re-reading (at least once).

## A Note on Resources

Through the MIT libraries, you can find several useful tools to help you pursue your research. Among them: the OED (Oxford English Dictionary), the standard for historical study of words; the MLA (Modern Language Association) bibliography, with links to scholarly articles and books we own as well as many more available though Interlibrary Loan; and EEBO (Early English Books Online), a remarkable resource claiming to include scanned copies of all books printed in England before the Restoration.

## Requirements

This subject requires that you be **willing to try** to think deeply, pursue research independently, write cogently, play constructively, and contribute creatively to group projects. Because this is an advanced seminar, I am presuming you bring to the table some background in literature, history, and/or drama. I also presume you bring a passion for (some kinds of) learning and will actively work to make this subject fit your passions.

As a Literature seminar, with CI-M credit for majors, this subject emphasizes oral and written communication. As a theatrical experiment, the form of this communication may vary from the standard paper model, but I would like you to write at least **one** "formal" analytic essay during the semester. You **may** write both your 5-page and 10-page essays in standard analytic form. I would recommend this discipline if:

- You know you want to pursue advanced study of Literature in graduate school.
- You know you need to work on your analytic writing skills.
- You like to write analytic papers because it is a very good way to focus and hone your ideas.

If, on the other hand, you wish to work on a project of a different sort that fits our subject, such as a multimedia essay, a research site, a theatrical experiment, and/or some other model of lasting communication, you are welcome to do so, in consultation with me.

In addition, I ask that you take stock of your skills and accomplishments at three points in the semester: the first and last will be written down, the middle will be conveyed to me through individual conferences during the two weeks after spring break. These are not graded work, but they should help me assess your contribution and learning throughout the semester.

You can't put on a play if the actors don't show up. You can't pass this class if you aren't here to participate in discussions, group work, and performances. It's that kind of class.

Written work should be typed or word-processed (double-spaced, with standard margins and font sizes).

## Literature Section's Official Policy Statement

Plagiarism - use of another's intellectual work without acknowledgement - is a serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution consult the style guides available in the Writing and Communication Center in Stata and the MIT Web site on [Plagiarism](http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/avoiding-plagiarism/).

You cannot participate well if you are asleep, nearly asleep, or woozy with illness or exhaustion. Please take care of yourself - which obviously includes your body. Bring (unobtrusive) food and drink to class if this is helpful.

In addition to welcoming your participation in class, I encourage you to discuss your ideas and your writing with me during office hours, or at other times convenient for us both. I hope to meet with each of you individually during the first half of the semester.
